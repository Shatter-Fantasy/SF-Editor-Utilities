# SF Utilities
A early wip Unity utilities package that will contain general utilities for several things.

1. Methods to cast between collection types that is currently not possible or had issues with using just the LINQ ToList() method.
2. Graphic Libraries utilities that include batched drawing for rendering different shapes using GL commands. Example DrawGridMarquee for drawing a set of tiles from a grid.
3. Extenstions for different structs like Rect, Bounds, and Vectors.
4. Asset Database methods to help manipulate data in assets and also easily find assets without knowing the folder they are in. 

## WIP Documentation
The documentation for most SF packages are currently early work in progress.
At the moment the API documentation has all the fields, properties, and classes appearing.
Due note they don't have full descriptions yet, but they do show the class, method names, namespaces, value type for parameters, and variables.
